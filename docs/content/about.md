dbtective is a Rust-powered linter and "detective" for dbt metadata best practices.
Our mission: help teams keep their dbt projects organized, documented, and production-ready.

## What does dbtective do?

- **Finds missing documentation** in models and seeds
- **Checks column types** for completeness
- **Verifies ownership** for sources
- **Enforces naming conventions** for marts and more

## Why dbtective?

As dbt projects grow, metadata quality can slip. dbtective shines a light on inconsistencies and helps you enforce best practices—so your data team can focus on what matters.
